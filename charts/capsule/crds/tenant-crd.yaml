                                value has no effect on scheduling. As a result, when
                                the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to
                                those domains. If value is nil, the constraint behaves
                                as if MinDomains is equal to 1. Valid values are integers
                                greater than 0. When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable
                                must be DoNotSchedule. \n For example, in a 3-zone
                                cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to
                                5 and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains),
                                so \"global minimum\" is treated as 0. In this situation,
                                new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod
                                is scheduled to any of the three zones, it will violate
                                MaxSkew. \n This is a beta field and requires the
                                MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled
                                (enabled by default)."

                                We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try
                                to put balanced number of pods into each bucket. We
                                define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
