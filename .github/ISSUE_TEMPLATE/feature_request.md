<!--
Yay, it look you're enjoying Capsule and, first, thanks for that!

We're trying to build a community drive Open Source project, so don't
hesitate proposing your enhancement ideas: keep in mind, since we would like
to keep it as agnostic as possible, to motivate all your assumptions.

# Describe the feature

A clear and concise description of the feature.

# What would the new user story look like?

How would the new interaction with Capsule look like? E.g.

1. What are the prerequisites for this?
2. Tenant owner creates a new _Namespace_
3. This is going to be attached to the _Tenant_
4. All the magic happens in the background

Feel free to add a diagram if that helps explain things.
