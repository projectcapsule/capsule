                            section are assumed to affect egress, and all policies
                            (whether or not they contain an ingress section) are assumed
                            to affect ingress. If you want to write an egress-only
                            policy, you must explicitly specify policyTypes [ "Egress"
                            ]. Likewise, if you want to write a policy that specifies
                            that no egress is allowed, you must specify a policyTypes
                            value that include "Egress" (since such a policy would
                            not include an egress section and would otherwise default
                            to just [ "Ingress" ]). This field is beta-level in 1.8
